journal="Acta Informatica",

volume="15",

pages="167--191",
abstract={There are a number of board games such as Checkers [2], Go [5], and
Gobang [8], which are known to be PSPACE-hard. This means that the problem to
determine the player having a winning strategy in a given situation on an
n{\texttimes}n board of one of these games is as hard to solve as everything
computable in polynomial space. PSPACE-completeness has been previously proven
for some combinatorial games played on graphs or by logical formulas [1, 9].},
